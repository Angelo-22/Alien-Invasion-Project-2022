The general purpose of the this Alien Invasion project is to get used to working on a project that 
spans multiple files. This will mean making sure my files are stored in there proper places so that my 
imports can work smoothly and make sense. This will also mean clearly labeling my functions and classes,
as well as putting appropriate descriptors to them to make sure they are easy to identify when I am deep
into the code. I'll try to create as much of my own code as possible, but we will rely on the examples in
python crash course 2nd edition to get us going.

The general purpose of the game it self is for a user controlled ship to be able to move right 
and left, while being able to shoot bullets at incoming enemy aliens. If an alien is shot, it should be 
removed from the game screen and points should be added to the users score. If the alien touches the
ship it should destroy it and end the game/take a life. I'd also like it to do general
things, such as keep track of highscores, possibly play music, and advance to different levels.

For now we start with the basics and move up from there. I started this code journey months ago with
chapter 1 of python crash course, and dusting off some old college course tricks from 2019. Now I'm
finely onto  the projects. Each day of practice is just one more step to a potential career.
The reminder now is to keep practicing and keep working on it. Even ten minutes of practice is ten minutes
closer to an end goal. Good luck and stay strong, you can do this.
